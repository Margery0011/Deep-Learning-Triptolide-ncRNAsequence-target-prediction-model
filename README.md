# The-research-on-the-Triptolide-nucleic-acid-sequence-target-prediction-model-

- Organized, categorized and pre-processed the available data of the action site of Triptolide on miRNAs. 
- Developed various deep learning models, including Deep Neural Network (DNN), Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), and Long-Short Time Memory (LSTM).
- Built a prediction models database based on the binding of Triptolide to miRNA. 
- Compared the training effects of each model and selected the optimal one.
- Predicted the action site of Triptolide on siRNAs with the optimal trained model.
